/**
 * Class Graph is a representation of a graph using an adjacency list.
 * 
 * The Graph class contains one data structure: a TreeSet<Vertex> that 
 * contains all the vertices in the graph. 
 * 
 * A TreeSet is a Set data structure where the elements are ordered. See
 * the Javadoc documentation for more information. The vertex ordering is
 * lexicographical (see Vertex class for more information)
 * 
 * This is just one possible implementation of a graph which you can use as a
 * starting point and also to provide a common ground for workshop submissions.
 * 
 * You are welcome to (and actually encouraged) to write your own implementation 
 * or extend this one, but for weekly workshop submissions, I will assume
 * the use of this class (unless you have a very good reason why you don't
 * want to use this class). 
 * 
 * Change Log:
 * 
 *  30/7/2019 - Initial release
 *
