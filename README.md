# COMP333 

This is the public repository for Comp333: Algorithm Theory and Design, offered in Semester 2, 2019 at Macquarie University.

The main purpose for this repository is to make it easier for us to share files and materials for workshops and assigmments.
We are going to require that you use very basic git commands.
